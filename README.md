Analysis of pet rehoming times in Rstudio.

# Statistical Theory Coursework (University of Leeds)

# Project Overview
This repository contains the coursework and code developed for the **Statistical Theory & Methods** module at the University of Leeds (Master of Data Science).

The primary goal of this project was to implement statistical estimators and validate theoretical concepts using **R**.

# Repository Structure
* `main.R`: R script containing the code.
* `mysample_head`: First 5 rows of the data used in the analysis.

# Outputs

# Data Privacy & Usage
The dataset used in this project was provided by the **University of Leeds School of Mathematics** for academic purposes. Due to institutional data sharing policies and intellectual property agreements, the original raw dataset cannot be shared publicly.

To demonstrate the functionality of the code, a **truncated sample** (containing only the first 5 rows) is provided.
